# Before anything read this: üòÇ


Hey there, fellow coders!

*Imagine this*: I started learning React just a week ago, and now I'm on a wild journey to turn the "Datashareportal" project from basic HTML and CSS into a full-blown React extravaganza. Spoiler alert: it's not all smooth sailing!

Get ready for a rollercoaster ride through my coding adventures. I might even attempt to break the internet with my use of console.log (or not)ü§£. You'll see some code that'll make you say, "What on Earth?!" and burst into laughter.

*But here's the deal:* I'm not here to show off my coding skills (or lack thereof). Nope, I'm here to prove that I'm determined to learn, grow, and yes, even have a good laugh at my coding mishaps. So, get ready to chuckle, giggle, and maybe even snort because having fun is the best way to learn!

Join me on this hilarious React adventure, and who knows, we might create something legendary (or just have a great time trying). 
Grab your popcorn, and let's code like there's no tomorrow! üçøüíªüöÄ


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
